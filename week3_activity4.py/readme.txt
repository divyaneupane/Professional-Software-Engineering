A college wants to manage its students, courses, and teachers. The college database includes:

1. Students: Each student has an ID, first name, last name, age, and the courses they are enrolled in.

2. Courses: Each course has a course code, course name, and a list of students enrolled.

3. Teachers: Each teacher has an ID, name, and the courses they teach.

A class called School_Database connects to an SQLite3 database.

It creates the necessary tables and inserts sample data for demonstration.

Methods are included to query the database for the total students in a course and the names of teachers teaching a course.
