Question: 
part2: Can we see the different objects respond differently to the same method call? if yes/ no explain it in short? and what the usage of this concept? 


Yes, different objects can respond differently to the same method call.
This concept is called polymorphism.

In this project, when the display() method is called on objects like Dog, Eagle, and Shark, the same method name is used, but each object behaves according to its own class.
